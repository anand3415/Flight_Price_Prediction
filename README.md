## Flight Price Prediction

### Problem Statement:
For purchasing an airplane ticket, the traditional purchase approach is to buy a ticket far in advance of the flightâ€™s departure date to avoid the risk that the price may increase quickly before the date of departure. However, this is not always the case; if airline corporations wish to increase sales, they can lower prices. Airlines employ a variety of factors to decide flight ticket rates, including whether the trip is around the holidays, the quantity of available seats on the plane, and even the month. Some of the variables can be seen, while others are hidden. In this context, customers are attempting to discover the best day to purchase a ticket, while airline firms, on the other hand, are attempting to maximize overall revenue.

The main objective here is -
1. Airline companies have the freedom to change the flight ticket prices at any moment. Travelers can save money if they choose to buy a ticket when its price is the lowest.

2. The problem is how to determine when is the best time to buy flight ticket for the desired destination and period.

3. Airline companies use many different variables to determine the flight ticket prices: indicator whether the travel is during the holidays, the number of free seats in the plane etc. Some of the variables are observed, but some of them are hidden.

4. In other word, when given the historical price and the current price of a flight for a specific departure date, algorithms need to determine whether it is suitable to buy or wait.


#### Project Results:
Using the Data of flight fares and different routes covered by the Airlines throughtout the year, a model is built and trained to predict the approximate fare for a particular route.
so, after doing the model training we got 96% accuracy on this project using Random Forest Regressor algo.
